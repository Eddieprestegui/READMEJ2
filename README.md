# Sampling Music in Ableton 
### Eddie Prestegui M. 12/04/23
Today I will be using Ableton Live Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) to create a [derivative track](https://support.easysong.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039412313-What-is-a-Derivative-Work-#:~:text=A%20%22derivative%20work%22%20is%20any,to%20the%20melody%20or%20lyrics.). I will be looking at the [Arrangment view](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/arrangement-view/) in Ableton, more specifically I will be using the sample editor feature to edit the audio clip.
